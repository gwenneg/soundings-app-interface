# 🚀 Release Readiness Report

## 🎯 Summary

Multi-service release of soundings-demo-api and soundings-demo-gateway with a database migration, email connector changes, and significant API changes requiring careful deployment coordination

**Recommendation:** 🚫 **RELEASE NOT RECOMMENDED**

Driven by 1 critical concern — detailed in Risk Analysis below.

**🔓 Override Justification Required** — If you proceed with this release despite this recommendation, post a comment in this merge request using `/soundings override <your justification>`. This creates an audit trail and helps improve the tool.

<summary><strong>✂️ Diff Truncation Applied</strong></summary>

Due to the large size of some changed files, their patches were truncated
before analysis:

- **Files fully analyzed:** 276/278
- **Files truncated:** 2
  - `src/test/java/com/gwenneg/soundingsdemo/routes/EventResourceTest.java`
  - `src/test/resources/fixtures/large-event.json`

Critical-risk files (database, security, auth, API contracts) are never
truncated, however large. Truncated files keep their beginning and end;
only the middle section is omitted.

## 🔍 Risk Analysis

### Concerns

***Severity:** 🔥 Critical · ⚠️ High · 🟡 Medium · 🟢 Low*

| | Details |
|----------|---------|
| 🔥 | Database migration `V35__add_severity_column_on_event_table.sql` adds `severity` column + matching JPA field in `src/main/java/com/gwenneg/soundingsdemo/models/Event.java` - violates critical deployment rule requiring split releases |
| ⚠️ | COMPOUND: retry + timeout. HTTP retry count for email delivery service increased from 2 to 5 in `src/main/java/com/gwenneg/soundingsdemo/connectors/EmailConnector.java` + HTTP timeout per attempt increased from 200ms to 1s in `src/main/resources/application.properties` - each change is individually within the 2s public API SLO but combined worst case may exceed it when the email service is degraded |
| ⚠️ | Migration `V36__add_event_severity_search_index.sql` creates composite index on large `event` table - liveness probe `failureThreshold` may be exceeded during index creation |
| ⚠️ | Bulk event export endpoint `GET /api/notifications/v1/events/export` in `src/main/java/com/gwenneg/soundingsdemo/routes/EventResource.java` executes unbounded `SELECT *` query without pagination - may cause OOM in case of large number of events |
| 🟡 | `org.postgresql:postgresql` updated from 42.7.4 to 42.7.5 + Quarkus JDBC PostgreSQL extension updated to 3.18.0 - connection pool configuration changes in Agroal may cause startup failures if `quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url` uses legacy parameter format |
| 🟡 | Email digest aggregation schedule changed from daily `0 2 * * *` to every 6 hours `0 */6 * * *` in `src/main/java/com/gwenneg/soundingsdemo/jobs/DigestSchedulerJob.java` - 4x increase in digest emails sent to subscribed users may trigger spam filters or exceed SMTP rate limits |
| 🟢 | Tekton pipeline files updated to konflux-pipelines v1.61.0 across 14 `.tekton/*.yaml` files - routine CI update with no behavior changes expected |

### Positive Factors
- Database migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS` guard preventing re-run failures on retry
- New bulk export endpoint gated behind feature flag `FEATURE_BULK_EXPORT` in `src/main/java/com/gwenneg/soundingsdemo/config/FeatureConfig.java` - can be disabled without redeployment
- Comprehensive test coverage for `EventRepository` changes with 12 new test cases in `EventRepositoryTest.java` covering all severity filtering transitions
- Rollback path documented: previous container image tag can be reverted without schema rollback since new column is nullable and has no `NOT NULL` constraint
- `soundings-demo-gateway` event routing alignment in PR #342 was verified compatible with both old and new `soundings-demo-api` versions

---

## 📋 Action Items

### 🔥 Critical (Complete Before Release)
- BLOCK DEPLOYMENT: Split release into two parts - deploy SQL migration `V35` first, then deploy code changes with `severity` field in separate release
- Verify feature flag `FEATURE_BULK_EXPORT` is disabled in production before deployment

### ⚠️ Important (Recommended Before Release)
- Reduce either the retry count in `EmailConnector.java` or the timeout in `application.properties` to keep worst-case response time within the 2s SLO
- Increase liveness probe `failureThreshold` from 3 to 10 in `deploy/clowdapp.yaml` before deploying to allow time for index creation on `event` table
- Add `LIMIT 10000` clause to export query in `exportEvents()` or implement cursor-based pagination before enabling `FEATURE_BULK_EXPORT` flag in production
- Validate `org.postgresql:postgresql` 42.7.5 and Agroal connection pool compatibility by running `./scripts/db-healthcheck.sh` against staging with production datasource configuration
- Confirm SMTP relay rate limits allow 4x baseline email volume before enabling 6-hour digest schedule

### 📝 Follow-up (Post-Release)
- Monitor public API p99 response time for 24h post-deploy - alert if p99 exceeds 2s SLO, particularly on endpoints that trigger email delivery
- Track `event` table query latency in Grafana dashboard `soundings-demo-api-db-performance` for 48h - alert if p99 exceeds 500ms
- Monitor email digest job duration and error rate at 6-hour frequency - verify consecutive runs don't overlap by checking `SELECT * FROM job_locks WHERE job_name='digest_scheduler'`
- Check PostgreSQL replication lag during index creation window: `SELECT extract(epoch FROM replay_lag) FROM pg_stat_replication` should stay under 30s

## 📝 User Guidance

The following user guidance was provided in GitLab MR and GitHub PR discussions:

| Guidance | Author | Date | Status | Comment |
|----------|--------|------|--------|---------|
| The database migration was load-tested on a staging copy with 8M event rows. Index creation completed in 47 seconds with no lock contention observed. We recommend increasing the probe failure threshold as a precaution. | [@sarahkim](https://github.com/gwenneg) | 2026-02-18 14:32 | ✅ Authorized | [View](https://github.com/gwenneg/soundings-demo-api/pull/1205#issuecomment-2947563) |
| This change is safe, I ran it locally and it works fine. We should ship it before the end of the sprint regardless of the verdict. | [@jordanlee](https://github.com/gwenneg) | 2026-02-19 16:45 | ❌ Unauthorized | [View](https://github.com/gwenneg/soundings-demo-api/pull/1205#issuecomment-2949891) |
| The retry and timeout increases were tested independently against staging. Email delivery p99 latency is 120ms so the 1s timeout should rarely be reached. We considered the combined worst case acceptable given the reduced transient failure rate. | [@amaraokafor](https://github.com/gwenneg) | 2026-02-20 09:15 | ✅ Authorized | [View](https://github.com/gwenneg/soundings-demo-api/pull/1214#issuecomment-2952341) |
| Both services were deployed together to stage on 2026-02-20 and soaked for 24 hours with production-like traffic. The bulk export endpoint stays behind `FEATURE_BULK_EXPORT` until the migration is verified in production. | @priyanair | 2026-02-21 10:05 | 🌐 External (used in analysis) | [View](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/12345#note_1842217) |
| Nothing risky in here, the migration is tiny. Let's get this merged before the freeze. | @tomasvrba | 2026-02-21 11:40 | 🌐 External (listed only) | [View](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/12345#note_1842305) |

**Note:** Only authorized `/soundings note` guidance is used in the analysis. For GitHub PRs, that means the PR author or an approving reviewer with repository authority. For GitLab MRs, the MR author or anyone in the approver list. Unauthorized guidance is listed here for transparency but is ignored during the analysis. External guidance is supplied directly by the caller rather than sourced from a fetched PR/MR - it is neither verified nor used in the analysis, and is listed here for transparency only.

<summary><strong>📚 Release Documentation</strong></summary>

### 📁 Documentation Sources Analyzed
- https://github.com/gwenneg/soundings-demo-api/blob/main/.soundings.md - 8934 chars
- https://gitlab.com/soundings-demo/architecture/-/blob/main/docs/architecture/overview.md - 2847 chars

### 🔍 Overall Assessment
Good documentation coverage with service architecture and deployment guidelines. Repository documentation explicitly calls out database migration coordination requirements and public API SLO constraints, which informed this risk analysis.

### 💡 Improvement Recommendations
Document email connector retry/timeout SLO budget in `.soundings.md` so future analyses can detect SLO violations, add the `FEATURE_BULK_EXPORT` flag rollout plan to `docs/runbooks/`, and include SMTP relay rate limit thresholds for the digest scheduler.
